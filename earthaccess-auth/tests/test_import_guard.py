"""Importing earthaccess_auth must not import any heavy optional dependency.

Runs in a subprocess so this test is independent of what the surrounding
pytest process has already imported. The deps CAN be installed (they are, in
the workspace env) — the invariant is that importing the core never pulls
them in. CI additionally runs the whole suite in an env where they are not
installed at all.
